Interactive Navigation Menu:
This project is an interactive navigation menu with a fixed position, visible on all pages. The menu changes its color and style dynamically when the user scrolls the page or hovers over a menu item. This is achieved using HTML for the structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity.

Features
Fixed Position: The navigation menu stays at the top of the page even when scrolling.
Scroll Interaction: The background color or font color of the menu changes when the user scrolls the page.
Hover Effects: When a user hovers over a menu item, it changes color or style to indicate interactivity.
Responsive Design: The menu adapts to different screen sizes for optimal viewing on any device.
Technologies Used
HTML: For creating the structure of the navigation menu.
CSS: For styling the navigation menu and implementing the hover and scroll effects.
JavaScript: For adding interactivity to the menu, such as changing styles when scrolling or hovering.
